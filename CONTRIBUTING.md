### 💡 Good First Issues
Add camera controls or zoom

Improve mobile experience

Create a starfield or galaxy background

Add audio reactivity

Use shaders for funky FX

Keep it modular — each object/component self-contained

Use GSAP timelines for fluid animation

Respect performance — optimize everything

Think beyond black holes — let’s go nebula, asteroids, warp drives, the whole damn Milky Way 🌀

## 👨‍🚀 Project Vision
“We want to create a digital universe — an immersive, explorable 3D space simulation where users can float between different space phenomena.”

You could even plug this into VR or WebXR later. 👀 Future-proofed.
